            <h2>What You Need to Know</h2>
          </header>
            <p>
              Suka is an incredibly loyal dog, and she is constantly on the watch to keep her family safe. Despite her intensity, she is incredibly loving and gentle with the people she considers family. 
              She needs to be introduced to any new people outside of the house. The new person should have treats or a ball to give Suka while she's outside on a leash. If you take this slowly, she'll
              pretty much love you forever. She responds very well to a lot of commands in Spanish, but she understands English commands as well. She also loves it when you call her, "la niña" and say "muy bien".

            <h2>What You Need to Watch Out For</h2>
          </header>
            <p>
                This girl is incredibly observant. She would never steal food from you if you were in the room, but she'll absolutely swipe treats off the counter when you're gone.
                Keep any food off of the counters while you're gone to avoid having her eat it all. <br> Keep her kenneled if you're going to be gone for longer than like, ten minutes.
                She gets anxious when she is alone and may chew the furniture or doors, or she'll chase her sister. I do trust them together when I'm with them, but 
                Suka is a malinois and she has a decent prey drive. It's better safe than sorry, in my opinion. <br> When you are out walking Suka, do not let other people approach you 
                or she'll start barking like crazy. She considers strangers a threat to your safety. Just pull her collor close to the base of her head and tell her "no," then walk away.

            <p>
                Suka is a sensitive girl with many little ailments. She has a sensitive stomach, and has to eat a very specific diet to stay healthy. She is allergic to chicken and honestly
                probably other foods but we are trying to figure that out. Suka has had very itchy skin recently, possibly due to stress and/or food. <br> When you are out walking with her,
                try to avoid throwing sticks unless they're pretty big. A couple times she has bitten down wrong on a stick and hurt her mouth. She won't bark or eat for a whole day if that 
                happens. <br> For more information on her allergies or foods she can't eat, check the <a href="">medical</a> page.

            <p>
                Suka is currently being fed homemade food twice a day. She gets fed breakfast between 7 AM and 10 AM and dinner between 7 PM and 8 PM. We will have all her food prepared and 
                separated into portions before we leave. Tell her to wait when you set her food down, and be firm about it. Her release word is "okay".

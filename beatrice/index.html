    <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
      <p>Beatrice is a shy girl, and will most likely run away from you if you approach her too quickly. If you want to pet her, you might have some success by staying still with your hand 
        reached out for her to smell.<br> She does like gentle pets, but keep an eye out on her body language. Sometimes she gets overstimulated and will try to bite your hand. If she tries it, 
        just take your hands off and completely ignore her. She'll come back for more love eventually!<br>Beatrice is a very picky eater, and may not accept any treats. Even if she eats a treat one time, 
        she may reject it the second time you try to give it to her. One treat I've always had success with are seaweed chips. Just hold on to it tightly so she can rip little bits off. 
        She also occasionally likes spinach.</p>

    <h3>What You Need to Watch Out For</h3>
      <p>
        Beatrice likes to get herself locked into places. I don't know what it is about it, but the second you open up a bedroom or closet door, Bea will try to get in. 
        She's pretty fast and sneaky, so sometimes you won't notice when she darts inside.<br>Keep an eye out when you're opening up a door that you plan on keeping shut 
        later or else you'll lock her inside accidentally. Rooms she has been accidentally locked into so far have been...</p><br>

          <p>♡ The coat closet<br>♡ The guest bathroom<br>♡ Both bedrooms</p>
        </div><br><p>...so basically every room in the house. Don't worry though, she'll meow pretty loudly once she realizes she's stuck. Just keep an eye out!</p>
